    <p class="text_column">LYRICS: I got to keep movin', I got to keep movin' Blues fallin' down like hail, blues fallin' down like hail Hmm-mmm, blues fallin' down like hail, blues fallin' down like hail And the days keeps on worryin' me There's a hellhound on my trail, hellhound on my trail Hellhound on my trail If today was Christmas Eve, if today was Christmas Eve And tomorrow was Christmas Day If today was Christmas Eve, and tomorrow was Christmas Day Aw, wouldn't we have a time, baby? All I would need my little sweet rider just To pass the time away, huh-huh To pass the time away You sprinkled hot foot powder, mmm Mmm, around my door, all around my door You sprinkled hot foot powder All around your daddy's door, hmm-hmm-hmm It keep me with ramblin' mind, rider Every old place I go, every old place I go I can tell the wind is risin', the leaves tremblin' on the tree Tremblin' on the tree I can tell the wind is risin', leaves tremblin' on the tree Hmm-hmm, hmm-mmm All I need's my little sweet woman And to keep my company, hey, hey, hey My company </p>
    <p class="text_column">ABOUT: This song is about a man who is struggling through life and he knows he has to keep trying but is greatly struggling to do so. He is going down a path on life he wishes he wasn't on. He wants his partner there to keep him company because they are the light in his life. </p>
    <p class="text_column">VIBE: This blues song has a very bluesy tone to the song that makes the listener feel the sarrow of the man singing. </p>
